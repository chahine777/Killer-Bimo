# Killer Bimo

![Killer Bimo Banner](docs/banner.png)

My name is **Chahine Laadjal**, I'm **18 years old** from **Algeria**, and this is my **first ever project**.

I have **minimal experience** in engineering and cybersecurity, but I want to start learning and building things for real. Killer Bimo is the beginning of that journey.

## About Killer Bimo

Killer Bimo is my personal attempt to create a Flipper Zero‑style device, but made from scratch as a learning project. It's not professional, it's not perfect — it's just me trying to improve and understand hardware, coding, and cybersecurity step by step.

## Why I Started

I always wanted to get into engineering and cyber security, but I never had a real project. Killer Bimo is the first time I try to build something bigger than just watching tutorials.

This repository will track everything I learn, every mistake, and every improvement I make while building my own device.

# 📝 README.md

## Killer Bimo — My First Engineering Project

This repo contains everything I will use to build Killer Bimo: firmware, hardware drafts, notes, and ideas. It’s not finished or polished — it’s my learning path.

## Goals

* Learn engineering step by step
* Understand hardware and security tools
* Build something real even if it’s simple or rough

## Status

Everything here is still a **work in progress**, and will improve as I learn more.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KillerBimo.git
   ```
2. Explore the folders.
3. Follow my progress or add ideas if you want.
